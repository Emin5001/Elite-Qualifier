## Background

This application was created as a introductory project into the Code2College Elite Class. There was an option between a WebScraping project, a ChatBot, or a AutoCorrect algorith. I chose a ChatBot because it was something that I never created before, and I'm interested in AI and Machine Learning, and this project was my introductory into this field.

## Install

Expect to use Repl.it install system.

## Usage

In order to use this application, just interact with it like it is any other chatbot, and it will respond accordingly.
